## About This Project
This project uses Javascript to build an interactive dashboard exploring and analyzing belly button microbial diversity. In a sample size of 60 belly buttons, over 2300 species were discovered. Eight of those species were present in more than 70% of people, while the remaining species were rare in more than one person.
