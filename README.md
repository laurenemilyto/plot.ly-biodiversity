## About This Project
This project uses Javascript, Plotly and D3 to build an interactive dashboard exploring and analyzing belly button microbial diversity. The dashboard displays a bar chart showing Top 10 bacteria cultures found, a gauge chart showing belly button washing frequency, and a bubble chart showing the number of samples collected per OTU. The dashboard dynamically populates based on test subject ID selected. Demographic info for the subject ID is also displayed.  

In a sample size of 60 belly buttons, over 2300 species were discovered. Eight of those species were present in more than 70% of people, while the remaining species were rare in more than one person.
